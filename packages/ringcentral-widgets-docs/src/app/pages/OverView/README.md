## Introduction

RingCentral integration widgets aim to provide reusable UI components to allow developers to integrate RingCentral unified communication service into third party processes or tools more easily.

This project is built based on [RingCentral Integration Common Library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ringcentral-integration) and [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/). The basic idea is to connect modules in RingCentral Integration Common Library with React components to provide ready to use UI widgets.


## Play with Development Server

A development server is delivered with source so that developers can use it to get familiar with the project or do further development. To get development server runningï¼š

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ringcentral/ringcentral-js-widgets.git
cd ringcentral-js-widgets
```

Install dependent libraries:

```bash
yarn install
```

Create a file named `api-config.js` in following format in folder `dev-server` to specify app related info

```javascript
export default {
  appKey: ${app key},
  appSecret: ${app secret},
  server: ${server url},
};
```

Run following command to start development server

```bash
yarn dev-server
```

The development server is listening on port `8191` by default.
Open up your browser and access http://localhost:8191 to see how it works.

Note that the development server is using OAuth for authorization process.
Please make sure the app you specified in configuration above is setup with Redirect Uri `http://localhost:8191/redirect.html`.
