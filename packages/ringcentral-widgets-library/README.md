## Run your Storybook

```shell
yarn

yarn start
```

The server is listening on port `6006` by default.
Launch up browser and access http://localhost:6006 to see the storybook.

## Storybook

### Configuration

Storybook can be configured in several different ways. That’s why we need a config directory. We’ve added a -c option to the above NPM script mentioning ```.storybook``` as the config directory.

For the basic Storybook configuration file, you don’t need to do much, but simply tell Storybook where to find stories.

### Write your stories

Story is a single state of your component.
